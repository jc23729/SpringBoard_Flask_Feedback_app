It should have the following columns:

username - a unique primary key that is no longer than 20 characters.
password - a not-nullable column that is text
email - a not-nullable column that is unique and no longer than 50 characters.
first_name - a not-nullable column that is no longer than 30 characters.
last_name - a not-nullable column that is no longer than 30 characters.
